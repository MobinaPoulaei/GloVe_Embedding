# GloVe_Embedding
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings for natural language processing tasks. GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm developed by the Stanford NLP Group that generates word embeddings by aggregating global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a given corpus.

Contents
* Introduction to GloVe: An overview of GloVe embeddings and their significance in NLP.
* Data Preparation: Steps to prepare the corpus for training GloVe embeddings.
* Training GloVe Model: Instructions and code to train the GloVe model using the prepared corpus.
* Using Pre-trained GloVe Vectors: How to load and use pre-trained GloVe vectors for various NLP tasks.
* Visualization: Techniques to visualize GloVe embeddings using dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE.
* Applications: Examples of practical applications of GloVe embeddings in NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.
