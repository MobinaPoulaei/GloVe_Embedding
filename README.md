# GloVe_Embedding
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings for natural language processing tasks. GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm developed by the Stanford NLP Group that generates word embeddings by aggregating global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a given corpus.
